# FISHID
Datasets, Code and Results for Salmon Fish Identification

This repository will hold all datasets captured within the AquaExcel TNA project FISHID AE050006. Within this project in 2018 imagery data of #330 fish for the purpose of biometric identification were acquired. 

Therefore, sideview images and iris images of each fish were taken. Release of data, code and results will go hand in hand with the publication activities. In the first step the iris dataset will be provided which is denoted as Salom iris image database (SIIDB).
